Abstract. The next generation of tightly interconnected vehicles oers
a variety of new technological as well as business opportunities. Vehicles
form so called vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) in order to enable
vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I), vehicle-tohuman
(V2H), or in general vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication
and interaction. A variety of manufacturers started implementing speci
c use cases that are limited to their own products. However, a default
interaction standard for this new economy is still missing. Chorus Technology
presents a blockchain-based system that enables a manufacturer
agnostic platform solution that allows VANET participants to enact and
transact any kind of services and goods. This whitepaper lls the gap in
the state of the art by introducing a blockchain-based transaction and
interaction layer that enables our V2X platform for goods and services
required to kick-start the upcoming V2X economy. We present the advantages
of the system, outline the requirements and goals, as well as
the architecture of the Chorus V2X platform and eco-system. In addition,
we present a prototype that demonstrates how our system helps
mitigating trac congestions and at the same time provides a mean to
car insurance companies to incentivize their customers to practice good
driving behavior.
