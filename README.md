# Abstract.
The next generation of tightly interconnected vehicles offers a variety of new technological as well as  business opportunities. Vehicles form so called vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) in order to enable vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I), vehicle-to-human (V2H), or in general vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication and interaction. A variety of manufacturers started implementing specific use cases that are limited to their own products. However, a default interaction standard for this new economy is still missing. Chorus Mobility presents a blockchain-based system that enables a manufacturer agnostic platform solution that allows VANET participants to enact and transact any kind of services and goods. This whitepaper fills the gap in the state of the art by introducing a blockchain-based transaction and interaction layer that enables our V2X platform for goods and services required to kick-start the upcoming V2X economy. We present the advantages of the system, outline the requirements and goals, as well as the architecture of the Chorus V2X platform and eco-system. In addition, we present a prototype that demonstrates how our system helps mitigating traffic congestions and at the same time provides a mean to car insurance companies to incentivize their customers to practice good driving behavior.
